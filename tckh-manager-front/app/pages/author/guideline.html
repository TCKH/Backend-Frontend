        <h3 class="blue">Submission categories</h3> <p>Please click the links below for corresponding manuscript preparation guidelines: </p> <ul> <li><a href="http://www.ifets.info/rev.php?pub=true">Peer reviewed publications</a>&nbsp;(Full length articles, maximum 7000 words) </li></ul> <p><strong>  Please make sure that you use the ET&amp;S template along with the add-ins tool for preparing your manuscripts: <a href="/Files/[ETS]Sample_Article.doc" target="_blank">here</a></strong>.</p>  <p>  Please make sure that your article is within 7000 words (including everything - title, author names, affiliations, abstract, keywords, main body, references, appendices - everything). Papers that are longer than the maximum limit may experience significant delays in review process, as they will be sent back to authors at whatever stage we notice this problem.</p> <p>The articles should be original, unpublished, and not in consideration for publication elsewhere at the time of submission to Educational Technology &amp; Society and during the review process.</p><p><b>Authors are also responsible for making sure that the manuscript does not have any language related problems. </b>For non-native English authors, who do not have good command on English language, it is strongly recommended to take help from a native English speaker (or to use professional editing services). Journal does not provide such service, and <b>manuscripts with poor English will be returned to the authors without completing the review process.</b><br></p> <p>All peer review publications will be refereed in double-blind review process by at least two international reviewers with expertise in the relevant subject area. </p> <h3 class="blue">Submission procedure</h3> <p><b><font color="#ff0000">Authors, submitting articles for a particular special issue, should send their submissions directly to the appropriate Guest Editor.
