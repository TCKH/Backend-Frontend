In the meantime, the aim of school education lies not only in providing students with knowledge but also in encouraging them to construct knowledge actively. Consequently, in this study, an approach of integrating the guided peer-feedback strategy into e-book design was proposed. An experiment was conducted on an elementary school natural science course to explore its effectiveness in comparison with the conventional e-book development activity. It was expected that the guided peer-feedback approach could engage students in knowledge organizing and in-depth thinking while stimulating more innovative ideas. To assess the impacts of this approach, a quasi-experimental design method was adopted. The students were divided into two groups: the experimental group, in which the students learned with the guided peer-feedback strategy together with the e-book development approach, and the control group, in which the students learned with the conventional e-book development approach. The experimental results indicated that the integrated guided peer-feedback and e-book development strategy had significant impacts on the students¡¦ learning achievements and e-book project outcomes while reducing their cognitive load and increasing their innovative thinking tendency in the design process.</p></div></div><ul class="list-inline"><li><span class="label label-primary"><strong>Submitted:</strong>&nbsp;27-08-2016</span></li><li><span class="label label-warning"><strong>Revised:</strong>&nbsp;</span></li><li><span class="label label-success"><strong>Accepted:</strong>&nbsp;15-10-2016</span></li></ul></div><!--modal-body--></div><!--modal-content--></div><!--modal-dialog--></div><div class="modal text-left fade modalForthcoming" id="5997" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-labelledby="myLargeModalLabel" aria-hidden="false"><div class="modal-dialog modal-lg"><div class="modal-content"><div class="modal-header"><button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true">×</button><h4 class="modal-title" id="myModalLabel">Integrating dynamic mathematics software into cooperative learning environments in mathematics</h4></div><!--modal-header--><div class="modal-body"><div class="panel panel-default"><div class="panel-heading"><h5 class="panel-title"><strong>Author(s)</strong></h5></div><div class="panel-body"><h4>Yýlmaz Zengin, Enver Tatar</h4></div></div><div class="panel panel-default"><div class="panel-heading"><h5 class="panel-title"><strong>Abstract</strong></h5></div><div class="panel-body"><p>The aim of this study was to evaluate the implementation of the cooperative learning model supported with dynamic mathematics software (DMS), a reflection of constructivist learning theory in the classroom environment, in the teaching of mathematics. For this purpose, a workshop was conducted with the volunteer teachers about the implementation of the cooperative learning model supported with DMS. Dynamic materials and worksheets suitable for the quadratic functions and sequences were developed. The effect of implementing the cooperative learning model supported with DMS in the teaching of the quadratic functions and sequences on student performance as well as students’ views about the model were examined.   The study was carried out using an embedded design. The study group consisted of 61 high school students. A quadratic functions knowledge test, a sequences knowledge test, and open-ended questionnaire were used as data collection tools. The Mann–Whitney test and dependent t-test were used for the analysis of quantitative data, content and descriptive analyses were used for the analysis of qualitative data. As a result of analysis of the data, it was found that the model had a positive effect on student achievement. Moreover, the following students’ views were identified: the model enabled better understanding, it visualized and concretized the course, it created a pleasant and enjoyable learning environment, and it increased retention.</p></div></div><ul class="list-inline"><li><span class="label label-primary"><strong>Submitted:</strong>&nbsp;08-06-2016</span></li><li><span class="label label-warning"><strong>Revised:</strong>&nbsp;19-08-2016</span></li><li><span class="label label-success"><strong>Accepted:</strong>&nbsp;13-10-2016</span></li></ul></div><!--modal-body--></div><!--modal-content--></div><!--modal-dialog--></div><div class="modal text-left fade modalForthcoming" id="5883" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-labelledby="myLargeModalLabel" aria-hidden="false"><div class="modal-dialog modal-lg"><div class="modal-content"><div class="modal-header"><button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true">×</button><h4 class="modal-title" id="myModalLabel">Analyzing pauses in computer-assisted EFL writing¡ªa computer-keystroke-log perspective</h4></div><!--modal-header--><div class="modal-body"><div class="panel panel-default"><div class="panel-heading"><h5 class="panel-title"><strong>Author(s)</strong></h5></div><div class="panel-body"><h4>Cuiqin Xu, Yan Qi</h4></div></div><div class="panel panel-default"><div class="panel-heading"><h5 class="panel-title"><strong>Abstract</strong></h5></div><div class="panel-body"><p>Using computer keystroke logs, this study investigated how writing skill affected L2 writers¡¯ pausing patterns to gain insights into their management of the cognitive writing processes. The 59 participants, 29 in the more-skilled group and 30 in the less-skilled group, were recruited from a college English course at a key Chinese university. The two groups completed an argumentative essay in a computer classroom where Inputlog6.0 was installed to log their writing activities. Setting the pause threshold at 2 seconds, the study examined both the global pausing patterns and the interval pausing patterns by dividing each writing event into five equal intervals, and how the final text quality related to the pausing patterns. The results showed a significant effect of writing skill on the interval pausing patterns, but not on the global pausing patterns. Correlating significantly with the final text quality, the interval pausing patterns also revealed important differences in L2 writers¡¯ management of writing processes in terms of how one writing process dominates at specific intervals with interaction and shifts between other processes in a recursive fashion. Pedagogical implications are then discussed in light of these findings.</p></div></div><ul class="list-inline"><li><span class="label label-primary"><strong>Submitted:</strong>&nbsp;10-04-2016</span></li><li><span class="label label-warning"><strong>Revised:</strong>&nbsp;05-07-2016</span></li><li><span class="label label-success"><strong>Accepted:</strong>&nbsp;15-08-2016</span></li></ul></div><!--modal-body--></div><!--modal-content--></div><!--modal-dialog--></div><div class="modal text-left fade modalForthcoming" id="5880" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-labelledby="myLargeModalLabel" aria-hidden="false"><div class="modal-dialog modal-lg"><div class="modal-content"><div class="modal-header"><button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true">×</button><h4 class="modal-title" id="myModalLabel">Investigating the use of the Khan Academy and mathematics software with a flipped classroom approach in mathematics teaching</h4></div><!--modal-header--><div class="modal-body"><div class="panel panel-default"><div class="panel-heading"><h5 class="panel-title"><strong>Author(s)</strong></h5></div><div class="panel-body"><h4>Yýlmaz Zengin</h4></div></div><div class="panel panel-default"><div class="panel-heading"><h5 class="panel-title"><strong>Abstract</strong></h5></div><div class="panel-body"><p>The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of the flipped classroom approach designed by using Khan Academy and free open source software on students’ academic achievement and to examine students’ views about this approach.

In this study, the influence of a pedagogical agent’s presence in an instructional video was compared to a video that did not contain a pedagogical agent. The results indicated no significant differences on a multiple choice learning outcome measure or on a perceived mental effort measure that was rated both after the instructional sequence and after completion of the post-test. In addition, no significant differences were found between groups in relation to their training efficiency or instructional efficiency.

Development of metacognitive skills, including the conceptual framework provided by socio-cognitive theories that afford reflective thinking, such as actively monitoring, evaluating, and modifying one’s thinking, has been identified as important for novice programmers.  Studies have shown that metacognitive skills can be nurtured through the use of technology blended into educational activities. Designing metacognitive-related activities that focus on both social and cognitive development is both theoretically and practically challenging, especially in supporting the teaching and learning of computer programming. This paper describes six commonly-used strategies, viz., metacognitive scaffolding, reflective prompts, self-assessment, self-questioning, self-directed learning and graphic organizers, identified as important features that can be incorporated into computer-assisted learning tools in supporting computer programming learning. An experimental study was conducted to determine the effectiveness of these strategies.

Fifty-four students belonging to two eleventh grade courses from a public school in Bogotá - Colombia participated in the study. One of the student courses interacted with a hypermedia that contained, within its structure, a metacognitive scaffolding. The other course interacted with the hypermedia that did not have a scaffolding. Students were given the Embedded Figures Test (EFT) in order to classify them into field dependent, intermediate, and independent subjects. A Repeated Measures Analysis was conducted with two intra-subject variables: (1) CL and (2) LA. Findings indicate that significant differences exist between intrinsic and extraneous cognitive load due to the effect of the metacognitive scaffolding. Students that interacted with the metacognitive scaffolding exhibited significantly greater achievements than those that did not use the scaffolding. The field independent students also exhibited significant differences in CL with respect to their field independent and intermediate classmates.</p></div></div><ul class="list-inline"><li><span class="label label-primary"><strong>Submitted:</strong>&nbsp;20-02-2016</span></li><li><span class="label label-warning"><strong>Revised:</strong>&nbsp;11-05-2016</span></li><li><span class="label label-success"><strong>Accepted:</strong>&nbsp;26-06-2016</span></li></ul></div><!--modal-body--></div><!--modal-content--></div><!--modal-dialog--></div><div class="modal text-left fade modalForthcoming" id="5765" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-labelledby="myLargeModalLabel" aria-hidden="false"><div class="modal-dialog modal-lg"><div class="modal-content"><div class="modal-header"><button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true">×</button><h4 class="modal-title" id="myModalLabel">Social and Collaborative Interactions for Educational Content Enrichment in ULEs</h4></div><!--modal-header--><div class="modal-body"><div class="panel panel-default"><div class="panel-heading"><h5 class="panel-title"><strong>Author(s)</strong></h5></div><div class="panel-body"><h4>Rafael Dias Araújo, Taffarel Brant-Ribeiro, Igor Emmanuel Silva Mendonça, Miller Miranda Mendes, Fabiano Azevedo Dorça, Renan Gonçalves Cattelan</h4></div></div><div class="panel panel-default"><div class="panel-heading"><h5 class="panel-title"><strong>Abstract</strong></h5></div><div class="panel-body"><p>This article presents a social and collaborative model for content enrichment in Ubiquitous Learning Environments.

Researchers highlighted that teachers should promote their ability and knowledge to integrate technology into instruction (Mishra &amp; Koehler, 2006; Niess, 2005; Pierson, 1999). Furthermore, the use of technology-based learning environment which is effectively used to improve the technological pedagogical content knowledge of pre-service teachers has a crucial importance for the training of pre-service teachers. In this regard, the purpose of this study is investigating the technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK), TPACK related self-confidence, and perception of pre-service middle school mathematics teachers in terms of instructional technologies. In this study, TPACK Survey, TPACK Self-Confidence Survey, and TPACK Perception Survey were conducted on 427 pre-service middle school mathematics teachers in elementary mathematics education program. The data were analyzed quantitatively. Results showed that there was a significant relationship between gender and perception towards technology. Moreover, it might be concluded that pre-service teachers improve their knowledge and self confidence to use technology in elementary mathematics education programs. Lastly, there was a relationship between the use of technology and self-confidence towards the use of technology. That is, it may be inferred that self-confidence of pre-service teachers towards the use of educational technologies increases by the use instructional tools. </p></div></div><ul class="list-inline"><li><span class="label label-primary"><strong>Submitted:</strong>&nbsp;27-01-2016</span></li><li><span class="label label-warning"><strong>Revised:</strong>&nbsp;30-06-2016</span></li><li><span class="label label-success"><strong>Accepted:</strong>&nbsp;21-07-2016</span></li></ul></div><!--modal-body--></div><!--modal-content--></div><!--modal-dialog--></div><div class="modal text-left fade modalForthcoming" id="5715" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-labelledby="myLargeModalLabel" aria-hidden="false"><div class="modal-dialog modal-lg"><div class="modal-content"><div class="modal-header"><button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true">×</button><h4 class="modal-title" id="myModalLabel">The influences of the 2d image-based augmented reality and virtual reality on student learning</h4></div><!--modal-header--><div class="modal-body"><div class="panel panel-default"><div class="panel-heading"><h5 class="panel-title"><strong>Author(s)</strong></h5></div><div class="panel-body"><h4>Hsin-Hun Liou, Stephen J.H.

Conversely, augmented reality (AR) learning environments blend real-world environments so AR could enhance the effects of computer simulation and promote students¡¦ realistic experience. However, AR-based learning environments had a lot of dynamic real objects which may increase learners¡¦ mental effort. Moreover, paucity of research compared AR with VR and other mature technologies. Thus, the aim of this study is to compare the influence of the 2d image-based VR and AR in an inquiry-based astronomy course. The findings of this study suggested that the real objects presented in the AR system could reduce the mental load because students could take the real objects of the AR system as the reference objects of the movement of the moon. Furthermore, the sense of the immediacy is increased due to the fact that peers appear on the AR system. Accordingly, the real objects and the sense of the immediacy not only enhance the learning motivations, but also encourage the students to keep conducting the tasks.</p></div></div><ul class="list-inline"><li><span class="label label-primary"><strong>Submitted:</strong>&nbsp;19-01-2016</span></li><li><span class="label label-warning"><strong>Revised:</strong>&nbsp;30-06-2016</span></li><li><span class="label label-success"><strong>Accepted:</strong>&nbsp;22-06-2016</span></li></ul></div><!--modal-body--></div><!--modal-content--></div><!--modal-dialog--></div><div class="modal text-left fade modalForthcoming" id="5714" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-labelledby="myLargeModalLabel" aria-hidden="false"><div class="modal-dialog modal-lg"><div class="modal-content"><div class="modal-header"><button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true">×</button><h4 class="modal-title" id="myModalLabel">Student engagement in long-term collaborative EFL storytelling activities: An analysis of learners with English proficiency differences</h4></div><!--modal-header--><div class="modal-body"><div class="panel panel-default"><div class="panel-heading"><h5 class="panel-title"><strong>Author(s)</strong></h5></div><div class="panel-body"><h4>Yun-Yin Huang;Chen-Chung Liu;Yu Wang;Chin-Chung Tsai;Hung-Ming Lin</h4></div></div><div class="panel panel-default"><div class="panel-heading"><h5 class="panel-title"><strong>Abstract</strong></h5></div><div class="panel-body"><p>English proficiency difference among students has been a challenging pedagogical issue in EFL classroom worldwide. Collaborative digital storytelling has been adopted in language learning settings to increase motivation and engagement, especially for young learners. However, it remains unknown that if students of different proficiency levels can equally benefit from this collaborative approach. Thus, this study implemented a 17-month technology-enhanced collaborative storytelling activity and examined young students¡¦ pair performance, flow perception, and learning strategies in relation to students¡¦ English proficiency level. The students¡¦ proficiency level was found to be an influencing factor of their engagement patterns, use of learning strategies, and pair performance. These findings put forward the low-threshold-high-ceiling principle suggesting that collaborative activities should ensure students of different proficiency share the same goal while allowing different types of participation to maximize their engagement. The findings and pedagogical suggestions are hoped to address the issue of proficiency differences in EFL classroom and shed light on future implication and research of EFL collaborative storytelling activities.</p></div></div><ul class="list-inline"><li><span class="label label-primary"><strong>Submitted:</strong>&nbsp;19-01-2016</span></li><li><span class="label label-warning"><strong>Revised:</strong>&nbsp;03-08-2016</span></li><li><span class="label label-success"><strong>Accepted:</strong>&nbsp;08-09-2016</span></li></ul></div><!--modal-body--></div><!--modal-content--></div><!--modal-dialog--></div><div class="modal text-left fade modalForthcoming" id="5697" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-labelledby="myLargeModalLabel" aria-hidden="false"><div class="modal-dialog modal-lg"><div class="modal-content"><div class="modal-header"><button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true">×</button><h4 class="modal-title" id="myModalLabel">Effects of a Structured Resource-based Web Issue-Quest Approach on Students¡¦ Learning Performances in Computer Programming Courses</h4></div><!--modal-header--><div class="modal-body"><div class="panel panel-default"><div class="panel-heading"><h5 class="panel-title"><strong>Author(s)</strong></h5></div><div class="panel-body"><h4>Ting-Chia Hsu, Gwo-Jen Hwang</h4></div></div><div class="panel panel-default"><div class="panel-heading"><h5 class="panel-title"><strong>Abstract</strong></h5></div><div class="panel-body"><p>Programming concepts are important and challenging to novices who are beginning to study computer programming skills. In addition to the textbook content, students usually learn the concepts of programming from the web; however, it could be difficult for novice learners to effectively derive helpful information from such non-structured open resources. Few studies have addressed this issue by proposing different web issue-quest approaches and investigating the effects of learning with different web resources on students¡¦ learning performances in computer programming courses, not to mention the use of statistical methods for analyzing the factors affecting students¡¦ learning outcomes. Therefore, in this study, a structured-resource issue-quest approach is proposed to support structured programming learning activities. An issue-quest learning environment was developed, and an experiment was conducted to compare the learning achievement of the students who learned with the proposed approach (experimental group) with that of the students who learned with the conventional open-resource-based issue quest approach (control group). The participants were 418 tenth graders (214 in the experimental group and 204 in the control group) who were 16 years old on average. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) was employed to investigate and compare the effects of the Web Issue-Quest approaches (i.e., open resource-based issue quest and structured resource-based issue quest) on the students¡¦ learning perceptions based on an extended technology acceptance model (ETAM). The experimental results showed that the structured resource-based issue quest approach benefited the novices more in terms of their learning achievements related to the computer programming concepts. Meanwhile, the SEM analysis showed that the two groups of students had equivalent perceptions of the usefulness, ease-of-use and enjoyment of learning with the two issue quest modes. This implies that the structured resource-based issue quest approach was helpful to the students in terms of improving their learning performance, while the limitation of access to open resources did not affect their learning perceptions. </p></div></div><ul class="list-inline"><li><span class="label label-primary"><strong>Submitted:</strong>&nbsp;14-01-2016</span></li><li><span class="label label-warning"><strong>Revised:</strong>&nbsp;21-04-2016</span></li><li><span class="label label-success"><strong>Accepted:</strong>&nbsp;14-05-2016</span></li></ul></div><!--modal-body--></div><!--modal-content--></div><!--modal-dialog--></div><div class="modal text-left fade modalForthcoming" id="5692" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-labelledby="myLargeModalLabel" aria-hidden="false"><div class="modal-dialog modal-lg"><div class="modal-content"><div class="modal-header"><button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true">×</button><h4 class="modal-title" id="myModalLabel">Technology-Enhanced Peer Review: Benefits and Implications of Providing Multiple Reviews</h4></div><!--modal-header--><div class="modal-body"><div class="panel panel-default"><div class="panel-heading"><h5 class="panel-title"><strong>Author(s)</strong></h5></div><div class="panel-body"><h4>Pantelis M.

The impact of receiving peer comments (“receiver” perspective) is compared to that of reaching own insights by reviewing others’ work (“giver” perspective). In this study, 38 sophomore students were randomly assigned in two conditions and engaged in peer review activity facilitated by a web-based learning environment asking them to provide multiple reviews. In the Peer Reviewed (PR) condition students both reviewed peer work and received peer comments for their own work. By contrast, in the Self Reviewed (SR) condition students provided peer reviews, but did not receive any. Instead, they were asked to perform self reviewing, before proceeding to any revisions of their work. Result showed that the two groups were comparable in all aspects, suggesting that the lack of getting peer reviews can be efficiently alleviated by other type of scaffolds such as a scripted self review process. Overall, the study provides evidence that the review “giver” perspective (as opposed to the typical “receiver” perspective) is a vital option and has noteworthy implications for the design of technological systems that aim to flexibly support more efficient peer review schemes.</p></div></div><ul class="list-inline"><li><span class="label label-primary"><strong>Submitted:</strong>&nbsp;12-01-2016</span></li><li><span class="label label-warning"><strong>Revised:</strong>&nbsp;23-05-2016</span></li><li><span class="label label-success"><strong>Accepted:</strong>&nbsp;26-06-2016</span></li></ul></div><!--modal-body--></div><!--modal-content--></div><!--modal-dialog--></div><div class="modal text-left fade modalForthcoming" id="5673" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-labelledby="myLargeModalLabel" aria-hidden="false"><div class="modal-dialog modal-lg"><div class="modal-content"><div class="modal-header"><button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true">×</button><h4 class="modal-title" id="myModalLabel">Synchronized Pair Configuration in Virtualization-Based Lab for Learning Computer Networks</h4></div><!--modal-header--><div class="modal-body"><div class="panel panel-default"><div class="panel-heading"><h5 class="panel-title"><strong>Author(s)</strong></h5></div><div class="panel-body"><h4>Chaknarin Kongcharoen, Wu-Yuin Hwang, Gheorghita Ghinea</h4></div></div><div class="panel panel-default"><div class="panel-heading"><h5 class="panel-title"><strong>Abstract</strong></h5></div><div class="panel-body"><p>More studies are concentrating on using virtualization-based labs to facilitate computer or network learning concepts. Some benefits are lower hardware costs and greater flexibility in reconfiguring computer and network environments. However, few studies have investigated effective mechanisms for using virtualization fully for collaboration. Therefore, this study proposed one effective collaboration mechanism—synchronized pair configuration—in a virtualization-based lab and aimed to enhance interaction and collaboration between paired students to help them accomplish networks or systems configuration through one shared, synchronized terminal, which allows them to input commands simultaneously from two computers to accomplish tasks. Meanwhile, they can communicate through a chat window. In the experiment, university students were divided into an experimental group, using a synchronized pair configuration for lab assignments, and a control group, with students completing lab assignments individually. Results showed that the experimental group significantly outperformed the control group in learning achievement and had more confidence in their work; furthermore, the instructor’s workload was reduced. Finally, findings of interviews and questionnaires revealed that the experimental group considerably enjoyed the proposed mechanism and system and had high motivation to use them. Therefore, synchronized pair configuration in a virtualization-based lab is suitable for learning computer networks.</p></div></div><ul class="list-inline"><li><span class="label label-primary"><strong>Submitted:</strong>&nbsp;31-12-2015</span></li><li><span class="label label-warning"><strong>Revised:</strong>&nbsp;21-07-2016</span></li><li><span class="label label-success"><strong>Accepted:</strong>&nbsp;10-08-2016</span></li></ul></div><!--modal-body--></div><!--modal-content--></div><!--modal-dialog--></div><div class="modal text-left fade modalForthcoming" id="5672" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-labelledby="myLargeModalLabel" aria-hidden="false"><div class="modal-dialog modal-lg"><div class="modal-content"><div class="modal-header"><button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true">×</button><h4 class="modal-title" id="myModalLabel">Differences in views of school principals and teachers about technology integration </h4></div><!--modal-header--><div class="modal-body"><div class="panel panel-default"><div class="panel-heading"><h5 class="panel-title"><strong>Author(s)</strong></h5></div><div class="panel-body"><h4>Magdalena Claro, Miguel Nussbaum, Ximena López, Victoria Contardo</h4></div></div><div class="panel panel-default"><div class="panel-heading"><h5 class="panel-title"><strong>Abstract</strong></h5></div><div class="panel-body"><p>This paper studies how similar or different are the views of school principals and teachers in relation to a mobile computer lab (MCL) initiative implemented in 1591 public schools in Chile, and to characterize in which aspects their views diverge. A mixed methodology was developed in two stages: first a quantitative stage, where a self-administered questionnaire (web-based) was sent to the schools; and second, a qualitative stage where a case study was conducted in three schools. Results show a greater convergence in teachers and school principals views in relation to the contribution of ICT resources to teaching, and more divergence with respect to the implementation process. More specifically, differences were related to two aspects: (1) how appropriate were the conditions to use and learn how to use the new resources in the school context, and (2) who should be held accountable for the integration of ICT resources within the school organization. In addition, qualitative results revealed that school principals had vague information about the pedagogical integration of the MCLs in their schools. These findings show that to have more effective technology integration processes in schools, a closer presence of school leaders in teachers’ everyday pedagogical activities is required.

The purpose of this study was to develop a visualization tool to motivate learners to participate actively in collaborative online learning communities and examine its effects on online participation, perceived learning, perceived satisfaction, team project performance, and usability. Two types of visualization tool were developed: the A-type for representing group participation and interaction between groups, and the B-type for representing group participation and individual participation. Undergraduate students (N=118) were assigned randomly to one of three groups (A and B: experimental group, C: control group). The results showed that two types of visualization tool have significant effects on the perceived satisfaction, perceived learning, and team project performance. Regarding online participation, the B-type of visualization tool was found to be effective. The usability of the A and B groups was similar and many learners in both groups reported that the visualization tool motivated them to participate in online learning.

The main contribution of this work involves the adaptable capability of different levels of detail, which can be expanded for each rubric criterion as needed. Our rubrics platform provides specialized and intuitive tools to create and modify rubrics as well as managing metadata to support learning analytics. As an example of a practical assessment situation, a case study on Mechanical Computer Aided Design (MCAD) systems training is presented. The validation process in this scenario proved the effectiveness of our adaptable rubric platform for supporting formative assessment in a multifaceted and complex field such as MCAD. The system also showed the potential of collecting user interaction metadata, which can be used to analyze the evaluation process and guide further improvements in the teaching strategy.</p></div></div><ul class="list-inline"><li><span class="label label-primary"><strong>Submitted:</strong>&nbsp;23-12-2015</span></li><li><span class="label label-warning"><strong>Revised:</strong>&nbsp;16-08-2016</span></li><li><span class="label label-success"><strong>Accepted:</strong>&nbsp;23-08-2016</span></li></ul></div><!--modal-body--></div><!--modal-content--></div><!--modal-dialog--></div><div class="modal text-left fade modalForthcoming" id="5650" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-labelledby="myLargeModalLabel" aria-hidden="false"><div class="modal-dialog modal-lg"><div class="modal-content"><div class="modal-header"><button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true">×</button><h4 class="modal-title" id="myModalLabel">Exploring the Effects of Online Academic Help-Seeking and Flipped Learning on Improving Students¡¦ Learning</h4></div><!--modal-header--><div class="modal-body"><div class="panel panel-default"><div class="panel-heading"><h5 class="panel-title"><strong>Author(s)</strong></h5></div><div class="panel-body"><h4>Wen-Li Chyr, Pei-Di Shen, Yi-Chun Chiang, Jau-Bi Lin, Chia-Wen Tsai</h4></div></div><div class="panel panel-default"><div class="panel-heading"><h5 class="panel-title"><strong>Abstract</strong></h5></div><div class="panel-body"><p>This study explored the effects of online academic help-seeking (OAHS) and flipped learning (FL) on students¡¦ development of involvement, self-efficacy, and self-directed learning. A quasi-experiment was conducted to investigate whether students¡¦ involvement, self-efficacy, and self-directed learning increases over time if intervened, respectively, by OAHS, FL, and their combination. Three classes of first-year university students in a one-semester course were chosen for this empirical research. The 102 students were divided into three groups. The first group (G1, which received online OAHS and FL), and the second group (G2, which received online FL only), were the experimental groups. The last group (G3), which received the traditional teaching method in a blended course, served as the control group. The results indicate that G1 students¡¦ involvement, self-efficacy, and self-directed learning all improved under the condition of simultaneously applying OAHS and FL. In addition, this study also reveals that the application of FL alone could be helpful in G2 students¡¦ development of their involvement, self-efficacy, and self-directed learning. However, G3 students, who learned with traditional teaching method in a blended learning environment, did not have better development in their involvement, self-efficacy, and self-directed learning.

In the observable evidence, learning with computer games has been shown to improve performance on vocabulary recall tests. However, while simple recall can be a sign of learning, observation of skill application in communication is a better indicator of skill mastery. Further, observing this use in separate communicative contexts could constitute evidence of transferability of skills. Hence, this paper presents the results of two investigations of learning outcomes in EFL classes at a Japanese university using computer game-based lessons. The first study was a quasi-experiment comparing use of targeted words in a writing task between a group of students who participated in a computer game-based lesson, and a group of students who did not. The second study was a cross sectional analysis comparing use of targeted vocabulary in a writing task with amount of participation in computer game-based lessons. The results suggest that computer game-based approaches to foreign language education in real-world classrooms can improve transferability of learned vocabulary.</p></div></div><ul class="list-inline"><li><span class="label label-primary"><strong>Submitted:</strong>&nbsp;20-11-2015</span></li><li><span class="label label-warning"><strong>Revised:</strong>&nbsp;24-02-2016</span></li><li><span class="label label-success"><strong>Accepted:</strong>&nbsp;16-03-2016</span></li></ul></div><!--modal-body--></div><!--modal-content--></div><!--modal-dialog--></div><div class="modal text-left fade modalForthcoming" id="5597" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-labelledby="myLargeModalLabel" aria-hidden="false"><div class="modal-dialog modal-lg"><div class="modal-content"><div class="modal-header"><button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true">×</button><h4 class="modal-title" id="myModalLabel">How Augmented Reality Enables Conceptual Understanding of Challenging Science Content</h4></div><!--modal-header--><div class="modal-body"><div class="panel panel-default"><div class="panel-heading"><h5 class="panel-title"><strong>Author(s)</strong></h5></div><div class="panel-body"><h4>Susan Yoon, Emma Anderson, Joyce Lin, Karen Elinich</h4></div></div><div class="panel panel-default"><div class="panel-heading"><h5 class="panel-title"><strong>Abstract</strong></h5></div><div class="panel-body"><p>Research on learning about science has revealed that students often hold robust misconceptions about a number of scientific ideas.

We show that even given a short period for investigation in a science museum, students in the AR condition demonstrate significantly greater gains in knowledge over students in the non-AR condition. Through interview responses, we further show that the AR affords greater ability to visualize details and hidden information to help students learn the science.

Therefore, the current study examined the impact of an online learning community in a flipped classroom, specifically via mobile platforms, on EFL learners¡¦ oral proficiency and student perceptions. Fifty English-majored sophomores enrolled in two oral training classes at a four-year comprehensive university in central Taiwan participated in this study.

The results from multiple sources indicated that the online learning community not only facilitated meaningful and positive collaboration but also significantly improved the participants¡¦ oral proficiency, thus leading to more active engagement in highly interactive learning activities, such as storytelling, dialogue collaboration, class discussion, and group presentations.</p></div></div><ul class="list-inline"><li><span class="label label-primary"><strong>Submitted:</strong>&nbsp;05-11-2015</span></li><li><span class="label label-warning"><strong>Revised:</strong>&nbsp;22-06-2016</span></li><li><span class="label label-success"><strong>Accepted:</strong>&nbsp;10-08-2016</span></li></ul></div><!--modal-body--></div><!--modal-content--></div><!--modal-dialog--></div><div class="modal text-left fade modalForthcoming" id="5562" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-labelledby="myLargeModalLabel" aria-hidden="false"><div class="modal-dialog modal-lg"><div class="modal-content"><div class="modal-header"><button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true">×</button><h4 class="modal-title" id="myModalLabel">Journalogue: Voicing student challenges in writing through a classroom blog</h4></div><!--modal-header--><div class="modal-body"><div class="panel panel-default"><div class="panel-heading"><h5 class="panel-title"><strong>Author(s)</strong></h5></div><div class="panel-body"><h4>Suneeta Thomas</h4></div></div><div class="panel panel-default"><div class="panel-heading"><h5 class="panel-title"><strong>Abstract</strong></h5></div><div class="panel-body"><p>This study qualitatively analyzes the challenges presented by international undergraduate students in a freshman composition course at a large Midwestern university in the US. 15 students were divided into five groups, of three members each, with varying proficiency levels in writing. They were asked to submit reflections as journal/blog posts, on two assignments (each, a different genre). Each group was then asked to comment on their group members’ reflections, while the teacher remained a silent observer, to ensure a stress-free environment. With a total of 30 blog posts, and 60 comments, the data was qualitatively coded to display major themes. It was found that the journal/blog posts described student challenges in writing, but also shared optimism for learner growth. Collaborative reflection and learning was accomplished through students’ comments, which irrespective of language proficiency, showed identification with each other, and provided encouragement, and advice on how to deal with these challenges. Additionally, this online mode of expression allowed complete teacher access to understand linguistic challenges of students so as to make necessary alterations in the classroom. The paper concludes by presenting suggestions that can be pedagogically used to address the problems faced by students, and by delineating avenues for further research.</p></div></div><ul class="list-inline"><li><span class="label label-primary"><strong>Submitted:</strong>&nbsp;31-10-2015</span></li><li><span class="label label-warning"><strong>Revised:</strong>&nbsp;15-02-2016</span></li><li><span class="label label-success"><strong>Accepted:</strong>&nbsp;24-04-2016</span></li></ul></div><!--modal-body--></div><!--modal-content--></div><!--modal-dialog--></div><div class="modal text-left fade modalForthcoming" id="5560" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-labelledby="myLargeModalLabel" aria-hidden="false"><div class="modal-dialog modal-lg"><div class="modal-content"><div class="modal-header"><button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true">×</button><h4 class="modal-title" id="myModalLabel">The effectiveness of using cloud-based crossed-device interactive response system (CCIRS) system to support classical Chinese learning </h4></div><!--modal-header--><div class="modal-body"><div class="panel panel-default"><div class="panel-heading"><h5 class="panel-title"><strong>Author(s)</strong></h5></div><div class="panel-body"><h4>Yi-Hsuan Wang</h4></div></div><div class="panel panel-default"><div class="panel-heading"><h5 class="panel-title"><strong>Abstract</strong></h5></div><div class="panel-body"><p>The purpose of the present study was to examine the effects of integrating a cloud-based cross-device interactive response system (CCIRS) on enhancing students¡¦ classical Chinese learning. The system is a cloud-based IRS system which provides instructors and learners with an environment in which to achieve immediate interactive learning and discussion in the classroom. A quasi-experimental design was employed in which the experimental group (E.G.) learned classical Chinese with the system, while the control group (C.G.) followed their original learning method. The results revealed that the novice and medium-achievement learners in the E.G. performed significantly better than other E.G. students, and most students as well as the instructor gave positive feedback regarding the use of the system for course learning. In sum, CCIRS is an easy-to-use learning trigger that encourages students to participate in activities, arouses course discussion, and helps to achieve students¡¦ social and self-directed learning. The study concludes that the idea of ¡¥bring your own device¡¦ could be implemented with this system, while integrating educational factors such as game-based elements and competitive activities into the response system could reinforce flipped classroom learning. </p></div></div><ul class="list-inline"><li><span class="label label-primary"><strong>Submitted:</strong>&nbsp;31-10-2015</span></li><li><span class="label label-warning"><strong>Revised:</strong>&nbsp;09-07-2016</span></li><li><span class="label label-success"><strong>Accepted:</strong>&nbsp;03-08-2016</span></li></ul></div><!--modal-body--></div><!--modal-content--></div><!--modal-dialog--></div><div class="modal text-left fade modalForthcoming" id="5553" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-labelledby="myLargeModalLabel" aria-hidden="false"><div class="modal-dialog modal-lg"><div class="modal-content"><div class="modal-header"><button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true">×</button><h4 class="modal-title" id="myModalLabel">Conversational Agents Improve Peer Learning through Building on Prior Knowledge</h4></div><!--modal-header--><div class="modal-body"><div class="panel panel-default"><div class="panel-heading"><h5 class="panel-title"><strong>Author(s)</strong></h5></div><div class="panel-body"><h4>Stergios Tegos, Stavros Demetriadis</h4></div></div><div class="panel panel-default"><div class="panel-heading"><h5 class="panel-title"><strong>Abstract</strong></h5></div><div class="panel-body"><p>Research in computer-supported collaborative learning has indicated that conversational agents can be pedagogically beneficial when used to scaffold students’ online discussions. In this study, we investigate the impact of an agile conversational agent that triggers student dialogue by making interventions based on the academically productive talk framework. An experimental activity in the context of a university course involved 72 undergraduate students who discussed online in dyads. Two conditions were compared: (a) dyads who received agent interventions while working on a learning task (treatment) and (b) dyads who worked on the same task without any agent interference (control). Utilizing a concept map created by the course instructor, the conversational agent delivered unsolicited interventions that encouraged treatment students to build on their prior knowledge, linking their current contributions to the main domain principles discussed during the course. Study findings indicate that the agent intervention mode substantially improved both individual and group learning outcomes. Evidence suggests that the agent effect on learning performance was mediated by students’ explicit reasoning, which was also found to be enhanced in the treatment condition.</p></div></div><ul class="list-inline"><li><span class="label label-primary"><strong>Submitted:</strong>&nbsp;29-10-2015</span></li><li><span class="label label-warning"><strong>Revised:</strong>&nbsp;23-03-2016</span></li><li><span class="label label-success"><strong>Accepted:</strong>&nbsp;08-04-2016</span></li></ul></div><!--modal-body--></div><!--modal-content--></div><!--modal-dialog--></div><div class="modal text-left fade modalForthcoming" id="5536" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-labelledby="myLargeModalLabel" aria-hidden="false"><div class="modal-dialog modal-lg"><div class="modal-content"><div class="modal-header"><button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true">×</button><h4 class="modal-title" id="myModalLabel">Effects of the Team Competition-based Ubiquitous Gaming Approach on Students¡¦ Interactive Patterns, Collective Efficacy and Awareness of Collaboration and Communication</h4></div><!--modal-header--><div class="modal-body"><div class="panel panel-default"><div class="panel-heading"><h5 class="panel-title"><strong>Author(s)</strong></h5></div><div class="panel-body"><h4>Chih-Hung Chen,Gwo-Jen Hwang</h4></div></div><div class="panel panel-default"><div class="panel-heading"><h5 class="panel-title"><strong>Abstract</strong></h5></div><div class="panel-body"><p>Previous research has illustrated the importance of acquiring knowledge from authentic contexts; however, without full engagement, students¡¦ learning performance might not be as good as expected.

However, little was known on its influence of reading behaviors and outcomes. Thanks to the advance of e-book technology, it becomes possible to track reading rate and outcomes in a real-time manner by the underlying mobile devices. This study intends to examine the effects of the Mozart piece K.448 (sonata for two pianos in D major) on the learning anxiety, reading rates and reading comprehension of students for reading e-books. The quasi-experimental design was applied, and 62 senior grade elementary school students participated in this experiment. The results showed that when compared with a silent task (reading without the music), this piece of Mozart¡¦s music had positive effect in reducing learning anxiety, and improving the students¡¦ reading rates, reading comprehension and direct process performance. However, we found that the music had a negative effect on the students¡¦ attention for their interpretation process. We inferred that this Mozart¡¦s music might take part of attention resource. This was supported by the increase of students\' extraneous load while listening to Mozart music, which led to the insufficient concentration in the interpretation and the evaluation of content. Overall, the findings reveal that the use of certain music, such as Mozart K.488, can be a potential tool to enhance reading outcomes when using e-books.</p></div></div><ul class="list-inline"><li><span class="label label-primary"><strong>Submitted:</strong>&nbsp;02-10-2015</span></li><li><span class="label label-warning"><strong>Revised:</strong>&nbsp;29-06-2016</span></li><li><span class="label label-success"><strong>Accepted:</strong>&nbsp;27-09-2016</span></li></ul></div><!--modal-body--></div><!--modal-content--></div><!--modal-dialog--></div><div class="modal text-left fade modalForthcoming" id="5479" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-labelledby="myLargeModalLabel" aria-hidden="false"><div class="modal-dialog modal-lg"><div class="modal-content"><div class="modal-header"><button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true">×</button><h4 class="modal-title" id="myModalLabel">Learning through Blogging: Students¡¦ Perspectives in Collaborative Blog-Enhanced Learning Communities</h4></div><!--modal-header--><div class="modal-body"><div class="panel panel-default"><div class="panel-heading"><h5 class="panel-title"><strong>Author(s)</strong></h5></div><div class="panel-body"><h4>Yu-Chun Kuo, Brian R.

The experimental group utilized iPads with guided instruction, coupled with informal feedback from students, to target emergent literacy and early math skills; the control group did not have access to iPads. All students were given the Florida VPK Assessment at the beginning and end of the study. Results of the ANCOVA revealed significantly higher Phonological Awareness and Mathematics measures for the iPad class, suggesting that integrating mobile learning in content-specific areas using informal student feedback effectively increases early childhood education students’ academic achievement. Best practices for integrating mobile learning to enhance student engagement are discussed.</p></div></div><ul class="list-inline"><li><span class="label label-primary"><strong>Submitted:</strong>&nbsp;08-09-2015</span></li><li><span class="label label-warning"><strong>Revised:</strong>&nbsp;10-02-2016</span></li><li><span class="label label-success"><strong>Accepted:</strong>&nbsp;07-04-2016</span></li></ul></div><!--modal-body--></div><!--modal-content--></div><!--modal-dialog--></div><div class="modal text-left fade modalForthcoming" id="5428" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-labelledby="myLargeModalLabel" aria-hidden="false"><div class="modal-dialog modal-lg"><div class="modal-content"><div class="modal-header"><button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true">×</button><h4 class="modal-title" id="myModalLabel">Philosophy of Technology Assumptions in Educational Technology Leadership</h4></div><!--modal-header--><div class="modal-body"><div class="panel panel-default"><div class="panel-heading"><h5 class="panel-title"><strong>Author(s)</strong></h5></div><div class="panel-body"><h4>Mark David Webster</h4></div></div><div class="panel panel-default"><div class="panel-heading"><h5 class="panel-title"><strong>Abstract</strong></h5></div><div class="panel-body"><p>A qualitative study using grounded theory methods was conducted to a) examine what philosophy of technology assumptions are present in the thinking of K-12 technology leaders, b) investigate how the assumptions may influence technology decision making, and c) explore whether technological determinist assumptions are present. Subjects involved technology directors and instructional technology specialists from school districts, and data collection involved interviews and a written questionnaire. Three broad philosophy of technology views were widely held by participants, including an instrumental view of technology, technological optimism, and a technological determinist perspective that sees technological change as inevitable. Technology leaders were guided by two main approaches to technology decision making in cognitive dissonance with each other, represented by the categories Educational goals and curriculum should drive technology, and Keep up with Technology (or be left behind). The researcher concluded that as leaders deal with their perceived experience of the inevitability of technological change, and their concern for preparing students for a technological future, the core category Keep up with technology (or be left behind) is given the greater weight in technology decision making. A risk is that this can on occasion mean a quickness to adopt technology for the sake of technology, without aligning the technology implementation with educational goals.</p></div></div><ul class="list-inline"><li><span class="label label-primary"><strong>Submitted:</strong>&nbsp;06-09-2015</span></li><li><span class="label label-warning"><strong>Revised:</strong>&nbsp;24-02-2016</span></li><li><span class="label label-success"><strong>Accepted:</strong>&nbsp;15-04-2016</span></li></ul></div><!--modal-body--></div><!--modal-content--></div><!--modal-dialog--></div><div class="modal text-left fade modalForthcoming" id="5427" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-labelledby="myLargeModalLabel" aria-hidden="false"><div class="modal-dialog modal-lg"><div class="modal-content"><div class="modal-header"><button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true">×</button><h4 class="modal-title" id="myModalLabel">Are they thinking differently: A cross-cultural study on the relationship of thinking styles and emerging roles in Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning</h4></div><!--modal-header--><div class="modal-body"><div class="panel panel-default"><div class="panel-heading"><h5 class="panel-title"><strong>Author(s)</strong></h5></div><div class="panel-body"><h4>Xiaoqing GU1*, Huawen Wang1, Jon Mason2</h4></div></div><div class="panel panel-default"><div class="panel-heading"><h5 class="panel-title"><strong>Abstract</strong></h5></div><div class="panel-body"><p>Collaboration has been recognized as an effective way of learning by numerous studies. When collaboration involves students from different cultural backgrounds a question arises: will cultural differences influence the manner in which roles are adopted within collaborative learning? In this study, a correlation analysis was used to explore the relationship between such cultural factors and emerging roles among collaborating students from two universities in different countries (China and USA). The cultural factors that might hypothetically affect their collaboration were approximated to thinking styles using Sternberg¡¯s thinking styles inventory, while the roles that the students adopted according to preferences were coded with an adapted coding scheme. The results indicate that there is a significant relationship between students¡¯ thinking styles and their adopted roles. This implies that cultural factors, exhibited as thinking styles, can help explain the emerging roles that are adopted in Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL). The results can guide teachers in assigning appropriate roles to students with different backgrounds in order to improve the efficiency of collaboration during cross-cultural CSCL.</p></div></div><ul class="list-inline"><li><span class="label label-primary"><strong>Submitted:</strong>&nbsp;06-09-2015</span></li><li><span class="label label-warning"><strong>Revised:</strong>&nbsp;19-12-2015</span></li><li><span class="label label-success"><strong>Accepted:</strong>&nbsp;21-01-2016</span></li></ul></div><!--modal-body--></div><!--modal-content--></div><!--modal-dialog--></div><div class="modal text-left fade modalForthcoming" id="5419" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-labelledby="myLargeModalLabel" aria-hidden="false"><div class="modal-dialog modal-lg"><div class="modal-content"><div class="modal-header"><button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true">×</button><h4 class="modal-title" id="myModalLabel">Designing and Implementing Web-based Scaffolding Tools for Technology-enhanced Socioscientific Inquiry </h4></div><!--modal-header--><div class="modal-body"><div class="panel panel-default"><div class="panel-heading"><h5 class="panel-title"><strong>Author(s)</strong></h5></div><div class="panel-body"><h4>Suhkyung Shin, Thomas A.

This case study focused on how students used web-based scaffolding tools during SSI activities, and how students perceived the SSI unit and the scaffolding tools embedded in the SSI activities. A web-based SSI unit was developed and utilized in a technology-enhanced science classroom, and included three types of embedded annotations (definition, background information, thinking questions). The findings of this study suggest that students benefitted from web-based annotated scaffoldings in their individual reading and group discussions. The effective use of hard scaffolding may have contributed positively to students’ engagement in the SSI activities and allowed students to easily explore a variety of context-related hyperlinked resources. In addition, the hard scaffolding tools allowed the teacher greater flexibility to effectively monitor students’ learning progress, evaluate students’ understanding of the topic, and provide guidance as needed through questioning. A holistic and dynamic approach is recommended when teachers and instructional designers consider how web-based hard scaffolding tools might function to assist students’ learning in SSI.  </p></div></div><ul class="list-inline"><li><span class="label label-primary"><strong>Submitted:</strong>&nbsp;02-09-2015</span></li><li><span class="label label-warning"><strong>Revised:</strong>&nbsp;12-02-2016</span></li><li><span class="label label-success"><strong>Accepted:</strong>&nbsp;28-02-2016</span></li></ul></div><!--modal-body--></div><!--modal-content--></div><!--modal-dialog--></div><div class="modal text-left fade modalForthcoming" id="5282" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-labelledby="myLargeModalLabel" aria-hidden="false"><div class="modal-dialog modal-lg"><div class="modal-content"><div class="modal-header"><button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true">×</button><h4 class="modal-title" id="myModalLabel">Activities with Parents on the Computer: an ecological framework </h4></div><!--modal-header--><div class="modal-body"><div class="panel panel-default"><div class="panel-heading"><h5 class="panel-title"><strong>Author(s)</strong></h5></div><div class="panel-body"><h4>João Carlos Paiva, Carla Morais, Luciano Moreira</h4></div></div><div class="panel panel-default"><div class="panel-heading"><h5 class="panel-title"><strong>Abstract</strong></h5></div><div class="panel-body"><p>This paper proposes an ecological framework “Activities with Parents on the Computer” (APC) to bridge home and school contexts by involving parents and students in digital media based assignments. An exploratory case-study was conducted based on ten parent-child dyads that engaged in an APC at home. Attitudes were assessed through a self-evaluation questionnaire. Four parent-child dyads, that showed different patterns of attitudes, were studied in depth through semi-structured interviews. The findings revealed that parents and children have mixed attitudes towards APC. The performance in the activity varied according to the kind of parental involvement in homework and individuals’ relationship with digital media. Relevant insights helped to reframe the model in order to evaluate the relations with other living elements (e.g., friends) brought by technology into the ecological microsystems (e.g., home, school). Future research should focus on the development of more accurate instruments of evaluation, the role of teachers and other community members.   </p></div></div><ul class="list-inline"><li><span class="label label-primary"><strong>Submitted:</strong>&nbsp;24-06-2015</span></li><li><span class="label label-warning"><strong>Revised:</strong>&nbsp;25-10-2015</span></li><li><span class="label label-success"><strong>Accepted:</strong>&nbsp;18-06-2016</span></li></ul></div><!--modal-body--></div><!--modal-content--></div><!--modal-dialog--></div><div class="modal text-left fade modalForthcoming" id="5204" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-labelledby="myLargeModalLabel" aria-hidden="false"><div class="modal-dialog modal-lg"><div class="modal-content"><div class="modal-header"><button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true">×</button><h4 class="modal-title" id="myModalLabel">Wikis for a collaborative problem-solving (CPS) module for secondary school science</h4></div><!--modal-header--><div class="modal-body"><div class="panel panel-default"><div class="panel-heading"><h5 class="panel-title"><strong>Author(s)</strong></h5></div><div class="panel-body"><h4>Dorothy DeWitt, Norlidah Alias, Saedah Siraj, Jonathan Michael Spector</h4></div></div><div class="panel panel-default"><div class="panel-heading"><h5 class="panel-title"><strong>Abstract</strong></h5></div><div class="panel-body"><p>Collaborative problem solving (CPS) can support online learning by enabling interactions for social and cognitive processes. Teachers may not have sufficient knowledge to support such interactions, so support needs to be designed into learning modules for this purpose. This study investigates to what extent an online module for teaching nutrition in secondary school science, using a wiki for CPS, enables interactions, and social and cognitive processes. The module was implemented with 31 volunteer participants. Data collected from the online communications was analyzed for the types of interactions and processes based on the Community of Inquiry Framework. This was triangulated using transcripts of interviews with students. In addition, pretests and posttests were conducted to determine whether the learning outcomes were achieved. Analysis of the online communications showed that the interactions were mainly between learner and content (64.4%), with a large portion of cognitive processes (69.3%) but little social (4.0%), attitudes (9.9%), teaching processes (12.9%) and noise (5.9%). The findings suggest that the module could be used to improve outcomes of learning and encourage interactions for cognitive processes and online presences. The findings may provide insights in encouraging CPS for learning science online. </p></div></div><ul class="list-inline"><li><span class="label label-primary"><strong>Submitted:</strong>&nbsp;19-05-2015</span></li><li><span class="label label-warning"><strong>Revised:</strong>&nbsp;26-10-2015</span></li><li><span class="label label-success"><strong>Accepted:</strong>&nbsp;20-05-2016</span></li></ul></div><!--modal-body--></div><!--modal-content--></div><!--modal-dialog--></div><table class="table">
